# ------------------------------
# v1.2
# ------------------------------

# added
- getBoard @Game like specified in paper
- readBoard @HexBoard like specified (fucking job as i had to implement the union find afterwards)

# ------------------------------
# v1.3
# ------------------------------

# fixed
- KI’s Hexboard Player Change 
(didn’t change player so it couldn’t detect enemies on the board (that’s the cause for our thoughts of a wrong rotation))
- minor bugfixes

#todo
- neat code comments

# ------------------------------
# v1.4
# ------------------------------

# added
- loadState @ Game.py (you can specify a state to load there and watch what happened)

in main.py you can specify "machine". then MachineGUI is called which processes multiple iterations of the game and store the results in output.txt
you can then use the loadState to have a look into the logic of the game. The first value is the amount of moves per game

# ------------------------------
# v1.5
# ------------------------------

# added
- getVictoryPath(works really well, except for certain special situations...) @HexModel.py
- Hexagon got a new attribute(victorypath = 0)

# ------------------------------
# v1.6
# ------------------------------

# added
- New Weight definitions for patterns (;0-0,10-1,25-100) -> from 0 to 10 weight 0, from 10 to 25 weight 1, thereafter 100
- Size class added to store Size prettier.. size[0], size[1] -> .Size.m, .Size.n
- PlayerController.py holds all player information

# updated
- HexBoardKI and HexBoard now merged with Base class "HexModel" to just have a single class HexBoard (HexBoard.suppressEvents() is used to get the workaround for not calling the EventManager twice when in inter mode)
- Game and HexKI inherits from PlayerController where the information about the player is stored
- Menu view doesnt display choice of which player is starting when mode is "inter"

# ------------------------------
# v1.6.1
# ------------------------------

# updated
- minor change @PatternGenerator, new iterative weights added
